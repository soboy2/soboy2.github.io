title: 10 Days with Clojure
---

Did you ever meet a girl and think she's probably not the prettiest girl you know, but she sure has a winning personality? Such an encounter might warrant a date and maybe a a 2nd date. Well, that's what my last 10 days with Clojure has been like. I have to admit I was not so impressed the first 5 days. I felt bored and uninspired most of the time, but some good old quality time turned the tide.

To some Clojure might seem like the new kid on the clock, but it's simply the reincarnation of a good old programming language - Lisp. I know many developers, especially Java developers, who have been raving about Clojure. I even attended a couple of Clojure programming dojos organized at work. The only thing that seemed to linger with me after these sessions were the few pounds I gained from the pizza served at these dojos. I didn't have time to really explore Clojure outside of work and with time I stopped attending. And now I finally took the plunge.

For me, Clojure is a functional programming language with a steep learning curve. And, If you can get past the syntax you can see how expressive a programming language it is. It runs on the JVM and you know what that means. Portability. The one thing that is really sinking in for me is the idea of immutability. I am starting get to see its value. It means less of my application fighting for and over memory. Same variable I created is the same one referenced even it's modified. Uncle Bob does a way better job explaining this than I do.

So, where do I go from here. I am pretty much settled on using the MEAN stack (MongoDB-Express-Angular-NodeJS)  to build any mid size application needs I have. I expect this to be about 70% of applications I would write. 10% of this might be that huge enterprise like application I may need to write. Bye bye Java and hello Clojure is all I can say. I'm in no way verse in Clojure and would by far consider myself a novice. However, I have seen enough of Clojure to embrace it. i suggest you give it a try and who knows, a second date might just be around the corner.
